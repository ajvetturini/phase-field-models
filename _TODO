TODO Implementation List

-> Float32 vs Float64 is the biggest issue with Wertheim models. Is there a mathematically robust way to handle this?
-> Remaining energy models
-> Clean up codebase / comments
-> Finish 3D support + analysis files + clean up analysis creation a bit? Like make formatting a bit easier? idk
-> Try and do a meta-optimization of beta-K in the tension simulations
