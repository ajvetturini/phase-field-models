TODO Implementation List

-> Clean up Examples folder
-> Remaining energy models
-> Autodiff implementations
-> Results comparison w/ CUDA-based implementation!
     -> Time CUDA then use CUDA input to JAX since their "read_from" does not work
-> Clean up codebase / comments
-> Finish 3D support + analysis files + clean up analysis creation a bit? Like make formatting a bit easier? idk
-> Try and do a meta-optimization of beta-K in the tension simulations
